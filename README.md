# 🌍 Terrain Recognition using TensorFlow & Keras

This project implements a deep learning model to classify different types of terrain images using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on a custom dataset of terrain classes and uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to achieve accurate predictions.
